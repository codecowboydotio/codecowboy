I am a developer who likes to write about things that I find interesting.
Some of these interesting things I do as part of my day job, and some I don't.

I run a couple of meetups, which is fantastic fun and a great way to meet other people who do interesting things.
Meeting other people, and finding out what they're up to and doing is what I find exciting. 

My github root is here:
