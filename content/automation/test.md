# Intro
I've been doing a lot with terraform lately, and I've been looking for ways to make my terraform configurations a lot simpler and have less repetition. Like a lot of people, I've found myself repeating the same code over and over. An example is where I repeat the same resource over and over but with different configuration parameters. It's essentially the same resource. Why should I do this? **There has to be a better way.**
