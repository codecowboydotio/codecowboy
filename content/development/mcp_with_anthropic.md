# Intro
There has been a lot of hype on socials recently about MCP or Model Context Protocol. Essentially it's a protocol that allows LLM AI to be extended. Most of the extensions relate to providing context using your own data. 

This is what I am going to walk through here. 

I will walk through:
- Creating an MCP
- What works and what works better
- My discoveries so far


# TLDR
If you just want the code - it's here:

# Why
The reason I decided to initially play around with MCP was because I had a **high level of scepticism** regarding it. I've seen a **LOT** of posts on the internet that talk about it, how it's transformational and so on. I thought to myself "I'm going to look into this, but I'm going to do it bottom up and by writing a server".
