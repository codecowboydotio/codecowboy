# Intro
I recently sat down and thought to myself "I wonder how the current market of mini or micro kubernetes distributions is going". I've been using minikube for a bit and thought to myself it was about time to start using a few other distributions.

So I have been experimenting with different micro or mini distributions. 

This post is about **k0s**.

## k0s
**k0s** is an open source project that you can find here: [https://k0sproject.io/](https://k0sproject.io/)

## Install

### Single Node Cluster

### Multi Node Cluster

## Deployment

## Ingress

# Conclusion
I was very pleasantly surprised by **k0s** it was easy to deploy and get up and running in either a single node cluster or a multi node cluster. The documentation was very good, and **it just worked**. This is perhaps the most important part for me. As a developer, I want to have the ability to get up and running super fast, without a lot of fuss to be able to try out different configurations or deploy applications.
