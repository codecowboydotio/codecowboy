## Intro
I recently sat down and thought to myself "I wonder how the current market of mini or micro kubernetes distributions is going". I've been using minikube for a bit and thought to myself it was about time to start using a few other distributions.

So I have been experimenting with different micro or mini distributions. 

This post is about **k3s**.

## k3s
**k3s** is an open source project that you can find here: [https://k3s.io/] (https://k3s.io/).

k3s is an open soure project and is part of the CNCF - [https://www.cncf.io/projects/k3s/] (https://www.cncf.io/projects/k3s/) 

k3s is sponsored and developed primarily by Rancher.

## Install

The installation is very easy and similarly low touch as the other distributuions I've looked at so far.

### Single Node Cluster

Single node cluster installation is really easy is you use the defaults. 

Run the command:

```Bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

This will download and install the latest stable version of k3s by default for your platform. As I typically use Fedora [https://getfedora.org/] (https://getfedora.org/), I was initially very impressed that my OS of choice was automatically detected, and the appropraite packages were downloaded and installed without any problems.

```Bash
[root@kube ~]# curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

Checking the view of what's running by default, I see a few interesting things.

Traefik appears to be installed by default, **and** it has an ingress enabled by default!


### Multi Node Cluster
Multi node cluster deployment is essentially the same as a single node deployment, with an additional step to install and join additional nodes to the cluster.

Install the cluster master node as per a single cluster. This is the same step as above.

```Bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```
On the first node in your cluster, after a successful installation, check for a node token. This is used to join other nodes to the cluster.

```Bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token

K107368ba05971c9f7b89fc3c8612f31371ccb26dbd2fa0f1f78d52f7323daf9cbc::server:ac873d131ebcb77ed65dfdfd4500482b
```

Run the following command to download k3s and install it on the node. Pass the additional configuration options of:

**K3S_URL** - This is the IP or hostname of the api server. The first node that you installed.
**K3S_TOKEN** - This is the token that comes from the first node to allow other nodes to join the cluster.

```Bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://192.168.50.200:6443 K3S_TOKEN=K107368ba05971c9f7b89fc3c8612f31371ccb26dbd2fa0f1f78d52f7323daf9cbc::server:ac873d131ebcb77ed65dfdfd4500482b sh -
```

If we check the nodes that are part of the cluster now, we see that our new node has been successfully added to the cluster.

```Bash
[root@kube ~]# k3s kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
worker   Ready    <none>                 18m   v1.22.7+k3s1
kube     Ready    control-plane,master   23m   v1.22.7+k3s1
``` 

## Deployment

Again, I'll use my star wars API as an example deployment.

```Yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: svk-swapi-api
  labels:
    app: svk-swapi
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: svk-swapi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: svk-swapi
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: public.ecr.aws/y6q2t0j9/demos:swapi-api
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: svk-swapi
        ports:
          - containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: swapi-svc
  labels:
    app: svk-swapi
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: svk-swapi
  ports:
  - name: port
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
```

I create a deployment and a service for my starwars container using the manifest above. 
I can deploy this in the following way.

```Bash
kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml apply -f swapi.yaml
deployment.apps/svk-swapi-api created
service/swapi-svc created
```

We can see that the pod have been deployed successfully.

```Bash
[root@kube ~]# kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get pods -o wide
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP          NODE     NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
svk-swapi-api-6bbf7b44dd-qx2vx   1/1     Running   0          5m11s   10.42.0.9   kube     <none>           <none>
svk-swapi-api-6bbf7b44dd-glvz7   1/1     Running   0          5m11s   10.42.1.3   worker   <none>           <none>
```

Part of my deployment is to create a service. 

```Yaml
[root@kube ~]# kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get svc -o wide
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE     SELECTOR
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    33m     <none>
swapi-svc    ClusterIP   10.43.43.121   <none>        3000/TCP   7m39s   app=svk-swapi
```

I can validate that the service is working on the node by using curl

```Bash
curl 10.43.43.121:3000/people/1

{
  "edited": "2014-12-20T21:17:56.891Z",

  "skin_color": "fair",
  "hair_color": "blond",
  "height": "172",
  "eye_color": "blue",
  "mass": "77",
  "homeworld": 1,
  "birth_year": "19BBY",
  "image": "luke_skywalker.jpg",
  "id": 1,

    22
  ],
  "films": [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    6
  ]
}
```

## Storage

There is a local storage class provisioned by default. This is great because it means that I can use persistant volumes without any additional configuration right out of the box.

```Bash
[root@kube ~]# k3s kubectl get storageclasss
NAME                   PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
local-path (default)   rancher.io/local-path   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  35m
```

## CNI
**k3s** supports a wide range of CNI's, with all the usual suspects being available - flannel, cannel, calico and so on.

## Ingress
Traefik ingress controller is installed by default.

Using the following manifest we can use the default traefik ingress controller.
Things to note are that by default traefik will listen to ports 80 and 443, so I have had to modify the service on my **k3s** installation as well as add ingress rules.

```Yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: swapi-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "traefik"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: swapi-svc
            port:
              number: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: svk-swapi-api
  labels:
    app: svk-swapi
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: svk-swapi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: svk-swapi
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: public.ecr.aws/y6q2t0j9/demos:swapi-api
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: svk-swapi
        ports:
          - containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: swapi-svc
  labels:
    app: svk-swapi
spec:
  selector:
    app: svk-swapi
  ports:
  - name: port
    port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
```

I can validate this in a few different ways. Checking for types of ingress, I see the following. I see both nodes because at this point I am not using a load balancer across both nodes, I'm just using an ingress controller.

```Bash
[root@kube ~]# k3s kubectl get ingress
NAME            CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS                         PORTS   AGE
swapi-ingress   <none>   *       192.168.50.200,192.168.50.210   80      8m22s
```

Similarly the service has changed to listen on port 80.
```Bash
[root@kube ~]# k3s kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP   70m
swapi-svc    ClusterIP   10.43.43.121   <none>        80/TCP    44m
```

## Conclusion
**k3s** is relatively easy to install, configure and get going. I would say the documentation on the k3s site could be a little clearer and include relevant examples for deployment. I found myself going to check documentation for other bundles projects during deployment. While this isn't a problem per se, it would be nice it the documentation we all in one place. 

The installation is **different** from **k0s** in that you need to add worker nodes. This is not a good thing or a bad thing, it's just a different approach. I like the simplicty of just adding a worker node using a standard method using a token. There were no ssh problems to troubleshoot in doing this.

The fact that **k3s** includes **traefik** for ingress is a **HUGE** advantage. This cannot be understated. Easy routing and ingress makes **k3s** very neat. 

All in all, this is a good distribution for getting up and running quickly.
