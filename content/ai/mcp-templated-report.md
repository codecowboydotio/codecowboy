# Intro
I have been fooling around a lot with ai recently, and one of the things I've found myself doing is integrating with MCP servers and then using the projects feature in claude to generate custom reports.

## What is this?
I have set up a remote MCP server that pulls data from the Star Wars API (swapi). This is a remote MCP server, so I am hosting it on one of my domains. To keep this post short and on topic, I will confine myself to the claude components and not talk about the specifics of the MCP server itself. It's there, it works, and I can connect to it.

# Summary
This has been a long journey so far for the reader, but for me as a developer it's been very quick. It took me only a few minutes to refactor the code into a service using Claude. I have a robust service now that allows me to get Dockerfiles updated without too much difficulty. I just need to feed in the right paramters and away it goes, and performs the checks on my behalf, does the analysis, and updates the repository.

This is a neat way to keep your Dockerfiles updated and your repos clean!
