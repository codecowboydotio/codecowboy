# Intro
I have a side hobby where I try to create minimal container images.
There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary one is because I'm a complete geek.

Other reasons include:

- It's a neatness thing
- There's an engineering imperative in me to be minimalist
- I don't like waste
- The process of creation helps me understand the technology a little better
- Smaller images are great for testing at scale
